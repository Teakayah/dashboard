## 2026-05-24 - [Optimize Python membership checks with inline sets]
**Learning:** When checking membership against a small, constant collection of strings in Python, using an inline set literal (e.g., `x in {'a', 'b'}`) rather than a tuple provides O(1) lookups instead of O(N). Python's AST compiler optimizes this into a constant `frozenset` at compile-time.
**Action:** Always use inline set literals for constant membership checks in hot paths.

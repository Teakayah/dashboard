## 2026-05-25 - Playwright Clipboard Permissions on about:blank
**Learning:** Calling `dz.context.grant_permissions(['clipboard-read', 'clipboard-write'], origin=dz.url)` immediately after test startup fails with "Permission can't be granted to opaque origins" because `dz.url` is `about:blank` before `page.goto()` is called.
**Action:** Always call `page.goto(TARGET_URL)` before granting origin-specific permissions in Playwright tests.

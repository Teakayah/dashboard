## 2026-05-24 - [Optimize Python membership checks with inline sets]
**Learning:** When checking membership against a small, constant collection of strings in Python, using an inline set literal (e.g., `x in {'a', 'b'}`) rather than a tuple provides O(1) lookups instead of O(N). Python's AST compiler optimizes this into a constant `frozenset` at compile-time.
**Action:** Always use inline set literals for constant membership checks in hot paths.

**Learning:** Iterating row-by-row on DuckDB Arrow Table results using `result.get(i)` is slow due to proxy trap overhead. The native `.toArray()` method is significantly faster for extracting rows.
**Action:** Always use `.toArray()` when extracting data from DuckDB-Wasm results before iterating over them if specific processing (like BigInt serialization) is required.

## 2026-05-25 - Fix Flaky Playwright Page Load Timeouts
Coverage Gap: UI tests in `tests/test_dropzone.py` and `tests/test_interactivity.py` intermittently fail due to 30000ms timeouts on `dz.goto(DROPZONE_URL)`.
Learning: Playwright's default `goto` waits for the 'load' event, which can be flaky or excessively slow for pages relying on complex async initialization (like DuckDB-Wasm). The pages actually load successfully and return 200 OK much earlier.
Assertion: To reliably test this, change `goto` calls to use `wait_until='domcontentloaded'` and increase the timeout to 60000ms.
## 2026-05-27 - [Tests] Coverage Gap: Missing test coverage for `__main__` and fallback logic in deployment scripts
**Coverage Gap:** The `deployment/` python scripts had very low line coverage on certain files natively since the `if __name__ == '__main__':` execution blocks and network fallback paths were not covered by tests.
**Learning:** `sys.exit` execution scopes block standard testing tools from collecting correctly without explicit handling via tools like `runpy.run_path`, and catching the resulting `SystemExit` appropriately. However, executing `runpy.run_path` skips mocking decorators resulting in potentially dangerous execution of the deployment files and real network requests. We can fix this by writing unit tests to accurately cover missing statements natively (e.g. `mock_urlopen`), and omitting strictly top-level `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks with `# pragma: no cover`.
**Assertion:** Wrote individual tests for the edge-case fallbacks missing actual coverage explicitly, and properly ignored untested entrypoint block logic.
## 2026-06-02 - Missing StopIteration Coverage in Benchmark Script
Coverage Gap: `scripts/benchmark_final_test.py` was missing coverage on the `StopIteration` exception branch in `_read_csv_stripped` when dealing with an empty file payload.
Learning: To properly trigger a `StopIteration` when testing a loop iterating over lines of a file, supply `mock_open(read_data="")` without any newlines to ensure `next(reader)` fails on the first call.
Assertion: Wrapped the call to `_read_csv_stripped` in `tests/scripts/test_scripts.py` using `with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data="")):` to ensure the empty file state was covered correctly.

## 2025-05-18 - Safe DOM Manipulation
**Learning:** Found multiple usages of `.innerHTML` for DOM manipulation (clearing, injecting raw strings, and setting single options) which violate best security practices for preventing DOM-based XSS.
**Action:** Replaced `.innerHTML` assignments with safer methods: `.textContent = ''` for clearing elements, `.textContent` for updating text, and used `document.createElement()`, `className`, `.textContent`, and `appendChild()` for constructing new DOM nodes (e.g., in `nhpi_big6_comparison.html` and `dropzone/app.js`). Applied across all frontend files.
